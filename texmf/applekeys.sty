%% This is file `applekeys.sty',

%% This file assumes you have Kino's keysymbols files in both .eps (the original
%% versions) for use with latex+ghostscript processing via dvips and converted
%% versions in .pdf (easily created by dropping the .eps files onto, e.g., TeXShop)
%% for pdflatex processing.

%% There is nothing "religious" about the size or vertical placement of each of the
%% graphics; these just look ok to my eyes, at this time, especially with Lucida Bright.
%% You are free to change the size and placement as you see fit for personal use.
%% Just don't ascribe your choices to me.
%%
%% 2005/08/24 - Changed \newcommand to \DeclareRobustCommand to
%% 	allow easy use in section headings and table of contents. Note: still
%%	a problem with the hyperref package.
%%
%% 2012/01/04 - Modified by Vincent Goulet to add 'width' specifications to
%%              \includegraphics and use a subset of the symbols.
